# NOTICE
These certs are self-signed certs created for the purpose of testing, it should go without saying however
DO NOT USE THESE CERTS FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE EXAMPLES PROVIDED. There's a script in the root of this 
project that you can use to generate more self signed certs if you need a larger scale test over WAN.
